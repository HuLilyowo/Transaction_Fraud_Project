# Transaction Fraud Project

This project aims to capture credit card transaction fraud with a supervised model. The final model can detect about 55% of all frauds in 3% of the population. Based on assumption - on average, $400 gain from every caught fraud and $20 lose on every false positive detection - the overall saving is over $20 million dollars with a 3% cutoff.
