# Transaction Fraud Project

This project aims to capture credit card transaction fraud with a supervised model. The final model can detect about 55% of all frauds in 3% of the population. Based on the assumption — on average, $400 gain from every caught fraud and $20 loss on every false positive detection — the overall saving is over $20 million with a 3% cutoff.
